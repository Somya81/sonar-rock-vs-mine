# Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction

## Overview
This is a beginner-level machine learning project where a classification model is built to predict whether an object is a **Rock** or a **Mine** based on sonar signal data.

## Dataset
The dataset contains numerical features extracted from sonar signals.
The target variable has two classes:
- R → Rock
- M → Mine

## Approach
- Loaded and analyzed the dataset using Pandas
- Performed train-test split with stratification
- Trained a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluated the model using accuracy score

## Results
The model achieved good accuracy on the test dataset.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Note
This project was created for learning purposes to understand basic machine learning classification workflow.
